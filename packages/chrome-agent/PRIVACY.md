# Signett Agent privacy disclosure

The public privacy policy is published at <https://www.signett.ai/privacy>.

Signett Agent has one purpose: let a user inspect and invoke the WebMCP tools exposed by
the active page through a model provider the user configures.

## Data handled

- The active page's title and URL are processed locally in the extension and are not
  sent to the model provider.
- Website access is optional and requested once from the user. It lets the extension
  check normal HTTP and HTTPS pages for WebMCP tools as the user navigates. Signett does
  not use that permission to read page DOM content, cookies, browsing history, or
  screenshots.
- When the user starts a run, the prompt, WebMCP tool definitions, and tool results are
  sent to the model endpoint selected by the user. The configured provider's own privacy
  terms apply to that transmission.
- The model endpoint and model name are stored locally in Chrome. By default, the API
  key is kept in in-memory `chrome.storage.session`. If the user explicitly enables
  **Remember on this device**, the key is placed in Chrome's unencrypted local extension
  storage until that option is disabled or the extension is removed.
- Optional personal information entered in Settings (name, email address, and postal
  address) is stored in Chrome's local extension storage. Non-empty fields are included
  in the context sent to the selected model provider at the start of each chat. The user
  can edit or clear these fields at any time.
- The active conversation, including prompts, tool calls, and tool results, is retained
  in `chrome.storage.session` so follow-up turns have context and the transcript survives
  closing the side panel. It is cleared when the user starts a new conversation or when
  Chrome or the extension restarts. It is never written to persistent local storage.

Signett does not operate a backend for this extension and does not receive, collect, sell,
or use this data for advertising. The extension does not read page DOM content, cookies,
browsing history, or screenshots.

Remote provider traffic is restricted to HTTPS. Plain HTTP is accepted only for loopback
development endpoints such as `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`.

Signett Agent's use of information complies with the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy,
including the Limited Use requirements.

# Product work tracker

This ordered list tracks the shortest path from an existing human website to a
production-ready agent interface. “Done” means implemented and covered by local,
package, documentation, and reference-app CI; it does not mean the pre-release API is
frozen.

|   # | Status   | Work item                      | Delivered outcome                                                                                                                                                     |
| --: | -------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1 | Deferred | Publish a real release         | Publish only after local API and reference integrations settle.                                                                                                       |
|   2 | Done     | Agent-legible failures         | Field-level capped validation messages and coded tool errors cross the native boundary.                                                                               |
|   3 | Resolved | Agent arrives after page load  | Native WebMCP owns `modelContext` from document creation; late agents see registered tools. Late extension/polyfill bridges are injected explicitly, without polling. |
|   4 | Done     | React binding                  | Race-safe `useSignettTool` with status, error state, and explicit closure dependencies.                                                                               |
|   5 | Done     | Confirmation stage             | App-owned confirmation runs after authorization and before idempotency with auditable events.                                                                         |
|   6 | Done     | Durable idempotency path       | Phased store conformance, a shipped IndexedDB/Web Locks adapter, and a PostgreSQL recipe distinguish live, abandoned, completed, and safely released work.            |
|   7 | Done     | Completed mutation after abort | A completed handler wins with or without idempotency; verification has an optional independent deadline and the outcome remains observable.                           |
|   8 | Done     | Inspector                      | Optional dependency-free overlay preserves inspection state while showing exact inventory and privacy-safe lifecycle timing.                                          |
|   9 | Done     | Tool readiness lint            | Portable recursive diagnostics cover nested schemas and common agent-usability defects.                                                                               |
|  10 | Done     | Output contract                | Optional serialized byte budget warns without discarding completed effects.                                                                                           |
|  11 | Done     | Cross-instance duplicates      | Active names are scoped to the shared WebMCP context.                                                                                                                 |
|  12 | Done     | Agent-selection evaluations    | Saved-task harness separately scores selection, arguments, and authoritative completion.                                                                              |
|  13 | Deferred | Adapters beyond React          | Add only after real Vue or Svelte integrations prove the binding shape.                                                                                               |
|  14 | Backlog  | Scaffold command               | Revisit after real integrations show what can be generated without hiding application intent.                                                                         |
|  15 | Done     | Explicit unknown outcomes      | Failed reconciliation produces a non-retryable `outcome_unknown` result instead of collapsing into ordinary failure.                                                  |
|  16 | Done     | Replay-aware confirmation      | Consequential tools can prompt only when a new effect will run; authorization and verification still run on replay.                                                   |
|  17 | Done     | Operation journal              | Execute and recovery share a scoped durable correlation record, with browser and test adapters included.                                                              |
|  18 | Done     | Reload-safe recovery           | Durable in-flight claims survive page loss; fresh invocations recover them without speculatively repeating the effect.                                                |

|        1 | Done   | Define the design-partner gate   | Publish the target profile, discovery questions, pilot contract, scorecard, guarantees, and exact-intent production recipe.                             |
|        2 | Next   | Qualify three partner workflows  | Each has a real launch date, accountable owner, authoritative oracle, and one consequential workflow blocked on execution risk.                         |
|        3 | Next   | Run saved tasks with real agents | Establish selection, valid-argument, completion, and token baselines across representative tasks.                                                       |
|        4 | Next   | Harden the Inspector from usage  | Add value capture only if developers request it, and only behind explicit redaction/consent.                                                            |
|        5 | Next   | Release candidate                | Freeze the small proven surface, write migration/stability notes, then publish the first alpha.                                                         |
|        6 | Spec   | Trace observability              | OTLP traces, per-tool latency and error tables, and a Jaeger recipe with no new developer code; see [the observability spec](./specs/observability.md). |

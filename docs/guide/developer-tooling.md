# Developer tooling

## Framework lifecycle

Import `useSignettTool` from `signett/react`. It exposes a tool for its component
lifetime and serializes same-name teardown and remount, including React StrictMode when
registration is still in flight. Its dependency list is required so a first-render
handler closure cannot be frozen accidentally; include every reactive value used by
the tool callbacks.

## Application activity state

An agent call begins outside the application's normal button or form event handler.
Use `useSignettActivity` when the human interface should still show that call's progress:

```tsx
import { useSignettActivity } from "@signett/webmcp/react";

function AgentOrderStatus({ signett }: { signett: SignettInterface<Session> }) {
  const { latest } = useSignettActivity(signett, {
    toolName: "place_order",
  });

  if (!latest) return null;
  if (latest.phase === "awaiting_confirmation") return <p>Review your order</p>;
  if (latest.phase === "verifying") return <p>Confirming with the store…</p>;
  if (latest.phase === "unknown")
    return <p>Checking whether the order completed…</p>;
  if (latest.phase === "succeeded" && latest.verified) {
    return <p>Order verified. Refreshing your receipt…</p>;
  }
  return <p>Updating your order…</p>;
}
```

The projection deliberately contains metadata only: tool name, invocation ID, phase,
timing, verification, and whether the result executed, replayed, or recovered. It does
not contain inputs, outputs, context, or error details. The seven stable phases are
`running`, `awaiting_confirmation`, `verifying`, `succeeded`, `declined`, `failed`, and
`unknown`.

For framework-neutral code, subscribe to the same projection directly:

```ts
import { createSignettActivity } from "@signett/webmcp";

const activity = createSignettActivity(signett, { toolName: "place_order" });
const stopRendering = activity.subscribe(() => {
  renderOrderActivity(activity.getSnapshot());
});

// When the application surface unmounts:
stopRendering();
activity.dispose();
```

Activity is best-effort presentation state. Never use it for authorization or as proof
that application state changed. A successful call without a `verify` hook has
`verified: false`; after verified success, refresh authoritative application state and
let the application's normal components render the result. Signett never mutates the
DOM or renders an activity interface. See
[Show agent activity in your application UI](./application-activity) for the complete
React and framework-neutral integration, phase semantics, concurrency, and testing.

## Readiness checks

`checkToolReadiness(tool)` returns deterministic diagnostics for ambiguous names and
descriptions, open object schemas, undocumented arguments, unbounded strings or arrays,
missing read-only hints, and invalid output budgets. `assertToolReady(tool)` turns those
diagnostics into one portable test failure. These checks improve definitions; only
real-agent task evaluations measure selection quality.

## Inspector

```ts
import { mountSignettInspector } from "signett/inspector";

const inspector = mountSignettInspector(signett);
// inspector.dispose();
```

The dependency-free browser overlay displays current tool schemas and exposure state,
plus one ordered row per call with outcome, total latency, and a phase waterfall.
Expand a call to inspect validation, policy, execution/replay/recovery, and verification
durations or its bounded error classification. Completed calls are also added to the
browser's User Timing track by default. The inspector captures no argument, result,
context, error message, or stack values and makes no network requests. Import it only
in development code so bundlers can exclude the entry point from production.

## Evaluation change checks

The `signett` package includes all three terminal workflows:

```sh
npx signett agent --help
npx signett eval --help
npx signett check --help
```

`signett agent` runs a prompt or saved task against a page's live WebMCP inventory in a
fresh headless Chrome profile. Use it for terminal and CI testing; the Chrome extension
is a separate interactive tool. Follow the
[headless-agent codelab](../tutorials/headless-agent-testing) and use the
[CLI reference](../reference/cli) for suite hooks and every option.

`signett/eval` exports the application-owned Cases and oracle-graded Trial Evidence
APIs used to build a repeatable change check:

```sh
signett eval scenarios/checkout.eval.mjs \
  --trials 5 \
  --against .signett/baselines/checkout.report.json
```

Signett writes both the normal evaluation report and a `check.json`/`check.md` pair. The
check works at Case-by-condition granularity, detects reduced trial coverage and Case
definition drift, and never lets an aggregate gain conceal a newly unsafe workflow.
The default safe-success tolerance is zero; set `--max-safe-regression` deliberately for
probabilistic agents. Latency and token gates are opt-in through
`--max-duration-ratio` and `--max-token-ratio`. GitHub Actions runs automatically add
the Markdown diagnosis to the job summary.

To review already-completed runs without spending more provider capacity:

```sh
signett check evidence/candidate/report.json \
  --against evidence/baseline/report.json
```
